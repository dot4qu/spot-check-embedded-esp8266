# spot-check-embedded-esp8266
Embedded C code for ESP8266 accessing custom API and sending data over UART

### NOTE: this is deprecated and exists to show the state of the project from zero to the alpha version using an esp8266 in conjunction with an ATMega328p. The continuation of this project can be found in [the newer esp32-based repo](https://www.github.com/dot4qu/spot-check-embedded)
